## 🤔 Why?  
Old CAPTCHAs are broken.  
They're frustrating, outdated, and sometimes even wrong (seriously, how are *those* not stairs?).

We built **I am a gamer not a robot** to make human verification **actually fun** — through games.

---

## 🎮 What We Built  
A fast-paced **retro Space Shooter**, built in JavaScript, where surviving = proving you're human.  
And yeah, it runs on **MetaQuest VR** too. Because why not dodge asteroids in 3D?

## 🤖 But What About Bots?  
We integrated a **pretrained Deep Q-Network (DQN)** model to simulate bot gameplay:  
- Didn't have time to train our own due to the 36-hour sprint  
- Ran the model once to benchmark performance  
- Calibrated our difficulty based on the result — humans win, bots don't

---

## 🔥 Features  
- 🎯 Play-to-verify CAPTCHA  
- 🤖 Bot resistance with real ML testing  
- 🕶️ VR-Ready (MetaQuest support)  
- 📦 Modular + embeddable  
- 🕹️ More games coming soon (Pong, Snake, Brick Breaker...)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Phaser.js, React
- **Backend:** Railway, Supabase
- **ML:** TensorFlow, TensorFlow.js (DQN pre-trained model)
- **VR:** WebXR for MetaQuest
